# How to: Create Bars Using ToolBarControl, MainMenuControl and StatusBarControl


<p>This example shows how to create three bars (File, Edit and StatusBar) using the MainMenuControl, ToolBarControl and StatusBarControl controls. In this example, the BarContainerControl is used to activate the Drag & Drop functionality for bars. Actions for bar elements are defined by commands implemented in the MyViewModel class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The window's DataContext is set to a MyViewModel class descendant, which is automatically generated by the DevExpress.Mvvm.POCO.ViewModelSource object. This descendant automatically generates commands for all public methods in the MyViewModel class (the OpenFileCommand, NewFileCommand and SetAlignmentCommand are generated).</p>
